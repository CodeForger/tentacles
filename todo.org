* APIs

These are just the API TODO list that was relevant when I started using org for todo
lists. It is not an all-inclusive list. The ones labeled TODO are the only ones that
still need to be done. Everything else, including what is labeled here as DONE, is
done.

** DONE Repo hooks
** DONE Git Data
** DONE Orgs
** TODO Pubsubhubbub

** TODO Handle Exceptions

The Github API tends to give '404' for general 'this does not exist' errors as well as
"that's completely wrong". We don't discern between these things in tentacles. As a matter
of fact, we just let clj-http throw exceptions for those things. The only time we handle
them specially is in API calls that translate to true/false in Clojure. In those cases
we catch the 404 exception and return false.

We need to figure out what the best way to handle these exceptional situations consistently.

* General
** TODO OAuth support

This is just waiting on somebody who cares enough to do it because I do not.

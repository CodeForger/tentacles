# tentacles

An octocat is nothing without his tentacles.

Tentacles is a Clojure library for working with the Github v3 API (and any future APIs). It is a very simple library and will implement all of the Github API. As of right this moment, it is not very complete and is far from being ready from public consumption. Once the API is completely implemented and tested (as much as possible), I'll release 0.1.0. When that happens, this library and the release will be announced on Twitter @IORayne.

## Usage
